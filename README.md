# Instacart_Project_Machinelearning
 Finished user segments based on time intervals and building a recommendation system by using machine  learning methods based on product choices of users
Research Background:			

Covid-19 has been a world spread pandemic in 2020. Thus, New Yorkers follow the quarantine policy and keep a social distance from each other. As we know, the most popular mode of transportation in NYC is by subway. However, the subway is one of the most dangerous transportation tools to spread Covid-19, which may increase the risk of having Covid-19 for subway passengers. Therefore, going out to get daily needs became a headache issue for New Yorkers. People in grocery stores are not practical to keep a social distance. During Covid-19 outbreaks, New York City published a “staying at home” order, which increased the demand for online grocery shopping. Instacart is a grocery delivery platform that has experienced rapid growth during the Covid-19 crisis. Now, users gain the value of staying home to flatten the curve and to reduce their own risk of getting the virus. Instacart makes a very compelling value proposition for users (Russel, 2020). 

Problem Statement:

Due to Covid-19 outbreak, the delivery needs of users cannot be fulfilled, and lots of groceries run out of stock fast. To balance grocery inventory and user demands, we established research on the customer segment and a recommendation system. Eventually, it could provide a better allocation of resources for both sides during the Covid-19 period. Our research group hopes to explore the user distribution and segment of Instacart by using Instacart’s open data. 
The primary research goals are doing user segments based on time intervals and building a recommendation system based on product choices of users. We expect our research could optimize the Supply side’s inventory allocation and increase the probability that customers get essential goods without breaking the social distancing rule. 

Methods:
- Used unsupervised learning methods, including PCA and K-mean Cluster to interpret user data
- Used Random Forest to label data and built recommendation system with Collaborative Filtering
